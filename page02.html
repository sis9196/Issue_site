			Throughout American history, censorship has been a part of our story, sometimes for good reasons, sometimes not.
			</p>

			<p>
			1776: When America declared independence, free speech became a big deal. But even then, there were times when censorship crept in.
			</p>

			<p>
			1798: The enactment of the Alien and Sedition Acts criminalized dissent, emphasizing the preference for power over criticism.
		</p>

			<p>
			1917: The Espionage Act made sure free speech stayed home while national security hogged the spotlight.
			</p>

			<p>
			1920: Prohibition: the Volstead Act poured cold water on the party and drained the spirits.
			</p>

			<p>
			1950s: McCarthyism turned paranoia into a trendsetter, while free speech took a backseat to conformity.</p>

			<p>
			1980s: The "war on drugs" elevated censorship to a heroic status. Nancy Reagan's "Just Say No" campaign epitomized the belief that ignorance equated to bliss.
			</p>

			<p>
			2000s: Enter social media, where censorship wears a digital cloak and goes by the name of algorithms. Who needs free speech when you have targeted ads?
